Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Melyanti Liando,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel Twice. The first was on 9-10 January 2022 and the second was on 28-30 July 2022. Room is spacious, got 2 beds. Breakfast is delicious, many variation of food. The gym facilities is good, the equipment is complete and clean. The meeting room is good The lobby also very cozy. Want to back here soon...."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,F Paul,5.0,"We enjoyed our stay here. The room is not as big as some 5 stars hotels in Java but it's very comfortable. The only difficulty I had was trying to adjust the room air conditioning. Swimming pool is nice but the breakfast buffet by the pool takes the cake. There are so many options, including Semarang specialties. I wish I could try everything! Food were laid out well and staff were accommodating."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Cynthia Isabella,5.0,"Two months ago, I stayed at Tentrem Hotel Semarang with my family. When we first arrived, we were immediately greeted by the bellboy, who also carried our suitcases. Then, at check-in time, we were served quickly, so we didn't have to wait too long, and after that, we were escorted immediately to our room. At night, we ordered food at the hotel via the telephone. It didn't take a long time for the food to arrive in our room. The next morning, when I had breakfast at the hotel, the waiters there greeted me with a friendly greeting and immediately escorted us to an empty seat. Then, the waiter also offered coffee or tea, and it was brought directly to our table. During our 4 days there, we were served in a professional and friendly manner. Their professionalism and great service made us want to go back there."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Karel K. Himawan,5.0,"The hotel that gives you a one of a kind experience! Unlike most 5-stars hotels, you can experience their authenticity in every corner of the hotel. They provide jamu and other traditional drinks in the mini bar. Semarang authentic food were provided in breakfast. Location is strategically located quite close to the heart of the city, but far enough to avoid hustle bustle of the city."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Francois Barbe,5.0,"First class service in a first class way. A real five stars hotel with all the amenities you dream of. Beds are soft, we sleep great. Staff at the pool or the restaurant is very helpful and friendly. A super memory for all our family.Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Winny Rachmani,5.0,"Our stay at Hotel Tentrem was the best decision. The room is excellent. Bed is spacious (for 2 adults and 2 children). I love the view from our room (It's the iconic swimming pool). Breakfast is amazing, especially if you are into local's food."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amelia,5.0,"One of the newest hotel in Semarang. A luxury hotel with traditional touch throughout, classy, elegant with characters. Staff are friendly and attentive. Great breakfast selections as they include many traditional semarang + Javanese foods. We will be back for sure."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Indra Nafi,5.0,"It was one of luxurious hotels in Semarang which offered the guests with convenient services. The location was strategic, the room was comfortable and super completed, and it's equipped with a shopping mall and an apartment. The breakfast menus are tasteful. Everyone enjoyed their meals, including special menus from local semarang food and beverage. However, the price for a night was a bit expensive because it made sense with the quality of service. Thank you."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,ony,4.0,"Hotel lobby is luxury, big as five star hotel standard. They prepare welcome drink. We should wait 20 minutes to get the room key after check in. Average size room for that price, I think the room is smaller compare to other five star hotel in Jakarta or Yogja with same price. Toilet amenities are complete. Breakfast food menus and taste are standar. This hotel connected to Tentrem mall. So you can easy find food or cafe for lunch or dinner."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riska Mordiana,5.0,"Great room, amazing lobby, wide variations in breakfast (western, eastern, original Semarang foods, pastries and... Ice cream!). The location is good, near Simpang Lima area. Great services from everyone too :)Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Firman Adi Prayogo,5.0,"Just one word, Amazing! My first stay at Tentrem Hotel was going very well as I have event there. The receptionist, Saskia (if I am not mistaken) gave me early check in and best room view ever (1709) if you prefer high floor. Furthermore, the breakfast is absolutely one thing that you have to enjoy! As they offer plenty variety of food and also famous Semarang street food. It is magic! Last, I appreciate Saskia when I did check out. She greets me with my name even before I gave my key card. I am truly honoured to stay at Tentrem Hotel Semarang. That is one thing that I never get at any hotel before. Fully recommend to stay here!"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Bobby Wibisono Wijaya,5.0,"I would like to recommend this place. The room was nice with all of the complementary of mini bar that free of charges. And what i really love is the breakfast staff at resto kayu manis specially zainal. Well most of the food contain sugar. I did mention to him about my diabetic issue and he really ask me about what kind of food i have to avoid, and ask the kitchen prepare it for me. Shout out to Zainal for taking care of me."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,I love Food,4.0,"The rooms are spacious, clean, and very pretty. Although some of the paintings dod freak me out. Staff were very friendly. What stood out to me most is the breakfast! They had a variety of cuisine from all across the globe, and also local Semarang food. It was the highlight of my stay. For the pool, meh. It felt very awkward swimming in front of people having breakfast. There's no seperation fence/plants, so people could easily come in and out of the breakfast place to the pool. The outdoor breakfast area and the pool is so uncomfortably close. But it's alright. The beautiful tile art in the pool made up for it. The water felt very fresh and nice, didn't feel oddly chemical ish like some pools do. It's across Tentrem mall and very near citraland so you have a variety of food choices near walking distance. There's lots of local street food near the hotel too. My stay at Tentrem Jogja was a 5/5 but I would give Tentrem Semarang a 4/5."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Samuel Lumentut,4.0,"This is the most expensive hotel in Semarang. One group with Hotel Tentrem Jogja and Hotel Chanti not far from Hotel Tentrem Semarang. Own by Sido Muncul, the company who produces the world famous Tolak Angin brand. So where to start? Is it luxurious? You bet, service? Excellent, location? Almost all Semarang legendary foods are located within 15 to 20 minutes drive from the hotel which is Godsend. Breakfast? Although the international menus were a bit boring, they have stalls of more than 10 legendary Semarang food like Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Gudeg Abimanyu, Asem Asem Koh Lim and many other. Oh don't forget to try their tolak angin ice cream. Its... Well ice cream with tolak angin taste... Literally. Its weird at first but its good the more you eat it. Pool also really great. Not too big but on 1 side they have transparent acrylic so it is so unique and cool to take photo at. The hotel is also connected directly to Tentrem mall. Upscale mall with not so many tenants but they have Ice Skating and cinema inside. They also have big aquarium with Arapaima fish native from Amazon river. Its great really. Alfamart is also like 25 steps away literally from hotel lobby should you want to buy water to stock into your room. Just perfect. So why 4 stars? Well.. Room is okay, aircon is cold. Bathroom also okay although the room that I stayed have no bathup. They have electric window that can be transparent or iced so you can't see inside. Pretty cool. The drapes are all provided by Serba Antik. The lifts also very high tech and basically has no button inside them. You push it outside the elevator where you wanna go. Very cool. They also give free minibar stocked with Sido Muncul products for you to try. So again why 4 stars? At this price I think the room should be a bit bigger, have bathup and fully carpeted. Granted they use some kind of marbles or Granite for the flooring, but for me personally plush carpet still make me feel like I'm in a 5 stars hotel instead of marbles or granite. The floor is cold to the touch always. If you use carpet it should be warm when you wanna just sit on the floor. Okay enough ranting. I'm kinda nitpicking over here. This hotel is not bad by any means. Might be the best in Semarang too, but well I'm not easily giving 5 stars anywhere. So this place should merit 4.5 stars for me. A great experience all in all... You should at least try once when you go to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Andrieas Nanda,5.0,"The BEST hotel in Semarang. The Location near simpang 5 (best for street food) easy access to nearby famous local food. Complete facility for children and parent, large glass view swimming pool, playground, gym, jacuzzi, sauna. Forgot something? Don't worry Access to tentrem mall is as easy as walking around your home. FnB the best breakfast and dinner you can get in semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Maya,5.0,"Impressed with Tentrem Hotel Yogyakarta, so we chose this hotel to stay while in Semarang. We stayed in not long after it’s opening in 2020. I loved the feeling when entering the Lobby, smell of Lemongrass was very comforting. In the corner you can found a cute Sido Muncul Cart displaying herbs drinks of Indonesia. The room is quite big. We slept in The double twin bed room. The bed is large enough to sleep one adult and one children. So if you’re a family with 2 small children, this room is perfectly fit! In the morning, breakfast was really really impressive yet surprising too. Literally, you don’t have to hustle round the city to have culinary experience. All the famous dishes in Semarang can be found here! From Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Lumpia Semarang, Asem Asem Koh Lim, Soto Semarang, Wedang Kacang, es Marem etc. Can’t wait to have staycation again in this hotel someday"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Handoko Limaho,5.0,"Truly the best Hotel in Semarang…when we were staying here with our family, the hotel was fully booked and we end up in the smoking room. However the management tries to remedy the situation by installing our room with ionizer and room purifier to disperse the scents. The facilities are amazing and especially the breakfast are to die for. We can get all the authentic Semarang food over here. Truly a must place to stay in Semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Martinus,3.0,"Stayed at the hotel during max occupancy i think. Lines were long, waiting time were also long, request got overlooked. basically they should be working much more efficiently at high load, because Tentrem bears the title best hotel in SMG. However room service is great, food quality was great. Breakfast selection also great. Pool bar service, Health center, Kids area also maintained great service."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,George Hadipoespito,4.0,"Great luxury hotel located in the heart of Semarang. Breakfast is the highlight: the restaurant serves samples of famous local heritage restaurants, it’s almost a complete Semarang culinary trip in one sitting. Unfortunately during this stay, service was a little slow: we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a staff to unlock the connecting doors between our two rooms."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,chandra amelia,5.0,"Tentrem Hotel never disappoint. Endless choices of breakfast buffet (ok, not endless, but they do have a vast array of breakfast delicacies), professional and friendly staffs (not to mention fast response too), and their pool is a must-see! Their gym opens until 11pm. Oh this one is also family friendly, the kids club is quite big and definitely entertaining."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Kiki Pratiwi,5.0,"I love my stay here. The staff are so friendly and very helpful. The ambience so lovely , combine between Javanese and Tionghoa. Love their breakfast variation menu. Will definitely stay there again when visit to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Freddy Samad,5.0,"Superb hotel as it should carrying the name Tentrem. Room is fabulous and spacious, made with top notch material like mable bathroom and high thread count sheets. The window between the bathroom and the room is electronically dimmable by a flick of switch, I know smart glass existed for quite a while but it's still fancy nonetheless. Soundproof of the room is great, toilet is spotless, shower drainage works fast; everything as it should be. Breakfast is buffet type and has everything from continental to local Semarang delicacies and everything in between, even ice cream if you fancy your early dessert. Their barrister is also very good with their coffee creations, I love both their hot and cold coffees. They also has a great juice bar, sometimes making a acidic delight detox concoction. I highly recommend the breakfast as your stay package. Hotel facilities are also great, swimming pool looks good and there's a direct access to the small mall. Is it expensive? Yes. Would I return? Absolutely."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Veronica Gunawan,5.0,"I could easily give 10 stars for this hotel! Wonderful 5 Star hotel with all of Semarang's iconic cuisines under one roof! I asked one of the chefs there. Apparently the hotel aims to provide local cuisines by buying them directly from the local vendors, so guests don't have to venture out in the heat to taste the local cuisines. Brilliant! It's also strategically located right at the city centre so it's very convenient and easy to get to other places like gift shops, restaurants, Lawang Sewu and Kota Lama. The staff were all so curteous, helpful and friendly, they make you feel at home right away. Even though we stayed during the high season when the hotel is fully booked, it's still easy to get help from the staff. Normally it would be very hard to get anything if the hotel is fully booked, but not here. I also fell in love with the peranakan-themed decor throughout the hotel, and the beautiful paintings they have there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and can't wait to go back and stay there again."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Yuniati Wibowo,5.0,Good place to stay when you're in Semarang. The service is very good. The staffs are kind and helpfull. Breakfast is superb. Surely will be back to stay in Hotel Tentrem again when when we go to Semarang👍👍👍Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riza Satria,2.0,"Service not as good as Tentrem Jogja.. especially breakfast service, staffs were not paying attention to who's first in queue, chaos inside the breakfast area, very low helping attitude among staffs to guests (helping open door, seating arrangements, cutting fruits, etc).. Should bring Tentrem Jogja staffs to help setting Tentrem's standard working culture to Tentrem Semarang.."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amrina Rosyada,5.0,"Stayed for 2 nights and 2 days with my husband, we had a large room, clean and sufficient equipment. We had a great 'sahur' with variety menu from local and western food. The taste was good and fresh. This hotel is located next to the tentrem mall where you can find your needs or just killing your time. However, there was a kind of renovation infront of the hotel that made us uncomfortable for waiting outside the hotel main entrance. Though, this hotel deserves the 5 stars for the hospitality of the staffs, the well-managed & clean room, and delicious food."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Linna,5.0,"It was my first time to stay in this hotel. I love the ambience and the design. I enjoyed the pool and the jacuzzi so much. The gym was also not bad. I just have an unpleasant experience during our check in. We booked 5 rooms in the same floor, and when we arrived from 6 hours drive at 2 p.m the rooms wasn't ready yet. We told them again we want all rooms in a row and they said it's no problem. At 3 p.m the staff told us only two rooms ready and we need to wait for few minutes for the other 3 rooms because we wanted it in a row so we decided to give the two rooms to our parents so they can rest. I said but the check in time is 3 p.m. She said it's because there was only two cleaning services in one floor. I just don't understand how can that be our problem but I just let it go. Few minutes later I heard the staff who serve us told her friend to tell other staff that the rooms was booked by us and to not give it to other guest. And few minutes from that the staff told us that we can't get the room in a row. And if we want to get a room in a same floor, we need to wait another half an hour. I was dissapointed because I know they probably gave our booked room to another guest after we stand waiting for more than an hour but we were all tired for the long drive and we didn't get our room yet so we decided to have some rest in the two rooms while waiting for the other rooms to be ready and the staff promised us to deliver the other rooms key to our room at 16.15. But we waited and nobody came and we need to call them again before they finally come and give us the rest of the room keys. When I get to my room, I saw yellow stain in our closet. It was easily removed by wet tissue, but it was gross and I just don't think it should happen. I think the room service was in a hurry to prepare the room. So yeah the hotel is very nice, they just need to improve the service, especially the front desk and cleaning service. I still give them a five star because I really like the hotel and hope it was just a one time mistake, they will improve and it won't happen again to anyone."

The quality of Service and the Hospitaly are excellence. All their staff are friendly and helpful. The Rooms are beautiful and well decorated with good combination of traditional and modern theme. The Breakfast is one of the main reason to stay in this hotel. It is the best breakfast buffet that I ever had particulaly the local traditional food. Don’t forget to try their Roti Kukus. It is a perfect companion for a cup of black coffee. Definitely will stay again in this hotel if visiting Semarang.

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Imam Kurniawan,4.0,"One nice hotel in Semarang, strategic location, side by side with the mall. New and clean. Friendly service. For the price offered now it is still not in accordance with the room facilities. The parking lot also fused with the mall parking, somewhat difficult, especially when the mall was crowded with visitors. The Touch Screen access lift is not suitable for current pandemic conditions. But overall this hotel is good and worth for visit"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Tia Rosmananingrum,5.0,"Modern yet maintain the Central Java traditional value. Cozy and the room is spacious. Food delicious. Located in central Semarang so there are street food vendors nearby. Of course, with all that reason the room rate is pricey but worth it"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,navjit Singh,5.0,"I stayed here during my visit in 2022. It's good hotel, apparently, the best in Semarang, as i heard. What was good here is, 1). There interiors in the lobby are awesome. There chandelier, the painting while u go to the elevators is amazingly real. You just can't walk towards elevators without noticing it. Amazing artist 2). The elevators are pretty protected and clean with tochless tech during covid times. 3). Regarding Rooms, the interior was amazing, nice curtains, carpets. They even have a pillow menu to choose from. Memory foams and all needed. Bed quality was good. Although I do feel, they can add a duvet to the bed, to add the grace to the room. 4). Restaurant is on 6th floor with indoor and pool side seating. They have good menu. Staff of hotel was courteous and helpful. Enjoyed my stay. Stay blessed, god bless! Regards #NaviWanderer"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,P S D,5.0,"This is a great hotel to stay if you are in Semarang City. Great room, service and friendly staff. Attentive is the key. Booked 3 executive rooms on the 19th floor which is also the executive lounge floor. Easy access. Breakfast menu changed from day to day. The only minus point is that they don't have a separated or dedicated parking space for hotel guest."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Indra Dani,5.0,"My First time staying at Tentrem hotel in Semarang. Seems to be a modern hotel in Semarang: modern elevator with smart touch screen and smart glass technology in the bathroom. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable. The hotel staff are really very friendly, polite and always ready to help. My experience in the pool, the staff is very helpful and provide accurate information. All the staff are very professional from security, receiptionist, cleaning service. For the breakfast menu, the food is very typical of Semarang, varied and delicious. The check-in check-out process is very fast, I really like it. Very recommended hotel in Semarang....."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Sarah R.,5.0,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Great interior, very clean. Everything is brand new. Mini bar is free and some other interesting freebies (say, Tolak Angin) that I like about staying at Tentrem property. Food was just so so, they can definitely improve. Decent coffee served at breakfast. Some of receptionists weren’t too responsive at times, I remember during checkout I had to call the front desk twice to ask for someone at the concierge to fetch my luggage, which was kinda irritating when you’re staying at a 5 star hotel, why was the phone unattended? Also what was irritating me the most was when I first arrived (Around 1.30 PM-ish) one receptionist told me I could not get in until 3 PM. Was tired from my flight and that was indeed a turn off. Luckily they found a room quickly, so that was forgiven. All the guys at the concierge were quick & attentive though. PS: This hotel is very crowded and busy these days, packed with family mostly, not recommended if you hate slow things or if you are a business traveller longing for quietness."

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Ajie Isdianto,3.0,"Pretty good for an old building. But be aware that the online booking service provides no options to choose between smoking or non-smoking room, you have to make the optional request probably by phone or e-mail. Because I checked-in late at night, they don't have a non-smoking room available, I had to stay for a night in a smoking room that doesn't have exhaust system nor windows that can be opened. Thankfully the problem resolved in the next morning."

The hotel remains as a gem in central Semarang, situated just across Simpang Lima and directly connected to Mall Ciputra.

The pool is located on the 4th floor but I did not try it out"

No food even I pay the breakfast!!!"
Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Nikodemus Gunawan,5.0,"the room with its carpet flooring and its sense of contemporary feeling from the overall furnishing are the reasons I like this particular hotel and even though the room is a little small, the fact that it was built next to the mall still make it worth staying here"

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Brian Nurharjadi,3.0,"If you're only a staff level employee, this hotel it's the place you want to stay to understand why your boss like their money so much. Beware it will take all your monthly payment just for 2 night (Semarang UMR)."
Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Avissa Suseno,4.0,"Been staying at this hotel for about 4 nights. It's 5 stars hotel that's opposite to Simpang Lima. It was quite a good experience since they provided us with the daily welcome drink that was Beer Plethok (Traditional beverage) at the lobby and you can take it as much as you wanted. They also provided you with toiletries everyday, kettle, coffee and tea bag, cup and glass. Unfortunately the shower wasn't as heavy as we expected and also the room wasn't opposite to Simpang Lima. This hotel also can help you to access to the Citraland Mall from the lobby since they have door that can lead you to the mall straight away. You don't have to pay for deposit, that's good."

Stand infront of Simpang Lima, the iconic venue in Semarang, Ciputra Hotel served you the best they have. Integrated with the shopping mall is another advantage of this hotel. I love the food so much, especially during breakfast. They served the best local that mixed by international foods and ofcourse in various kind of foods that you can choose. The minor issue for this five stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 hotel is the swimming pool so tiny and they fitness center still use ""an old"" equipments. But overall, staying in Ciputra Hotel while in Semarang is the best choice and worthed. I'm highly recommended this hotel."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Hendra Kusuma,4.0,"Shower area can be further cleaned by cleaning up the black grout spot (brushed with bleach / spray will loosened up the fungus growth) It need more power sources / wall plug in the room to allow laptop computer, Smartphones, etc. charging. Provide Hair Dryer as standard room convenience. Provide, 3 types of towels for 2 per room. Provide Hair shampoo & conditioner as standard (only shampoo was provided during my stay).. Repair / Secure ward robe door, so it does not drop / fall as I almost drop it when it slip off the track and almost drop on my foot (may crushed my feet from the weight of the mirror door). Provide shower door to prevent water splash during shower. Need constant daily supply of portable sandals"
Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,ana purna,2.0,"the hotel is old and needs makeover. the shower was never consistent, alternating between hot and cold water no matter the setting. some of the staff need better training. they lacked coordination with car rental. the breakfast selection had local choice, but the taste was under average."
Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Meida Ardina,5.0,"The only thing I don't like is the air-conditioner was just too cold for certain rooms. Also they need to add variation of food, I think. The sales might need to check and re-check the details of the reservation. Especially the date. But well mistake happened, it's been taken care of. I'm glad the sales did everything she could to heed my request, from my organisation, which was excellent from their part. I really appreciated the sales's effort! The meeting room was also good, but I suggest they add a whiteboard. Because flipchart isn't wide enough and some people found it a bit hard to see, especially those who were at the back. Everything else were amazing. Please keep up the good work!"

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Moto 4nn4,5.0,Good clean old fashion room. Spacious room. Working hoh/cols shower in bathroom. Aircon may cause aome irritate noise when set to highest speed guess due its usage but it still give the coolest air we want on hot summer day. Nowaday new hotel provide chiller but Santika still has the real refrigerator good to cool our bottle of drink. Poolnis spacious and the officer do the job to welcome the guest prepare the rest chair and provide the bath.. well compare nowaday hotel that guest NEED to ask or visit the towel counter.. Santika bring the even simpe customer experience ahead. Check in/out is fast the concierge bring our belonging to. room. Parking is spacious and due the hotel location in city area is very good. Breakfast is modesty but they still serve/pick it for guest while other hotel may loosen the requirement but we can understand if this is hotel's way signature to maintain hygiene in 'pandemic loosen time' but pls review it as common guest hotel may prefer to choose its own food. Free rentnfor bicyle very good.. Used it to nearestn convenience store.

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,B. Jonathan T.,3.0,"Used to be a quite fancy hotel. The lobby still looks premium but the ceiling has been water damaged and looks deteriorating. Once you enter the room it feels as budgety as a budget hotel. Cool white lights make it feel a little cheap, no real mugs in the room only paper cups and cheap plastic cups in the bathroom. The floor used to be made of carpet and contrasted with ceramic, now replaced with regular ceramic tiles for the whole room, they removed the bath tub and replaced it with a shower only. They removed the wallpapers and painted the walls brownish white. Much more to rant about for my disappointment. Overall it is a good hotel but as a person who used to go here all the time this makes me very sad and disappointed, They gutted almost everything that makes me enjoy staying here. Definitely no longer a 4 star hotel in terms of room feel except for the spacious rooms. The service and food still remains excellent as always."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Teguh Sunyoto,1.0,"At check in, we asked receptionist to store breast milk in their freezer (we also already wrote word ""freezer"" in the plastic milk container) as we plan for 2 nights stay. For the information, it was a 700ml breast milk that was pumped by my wife during our 4 days trip prior to arriving to this hotel. In fact, we have also asked this (whether the hotel can store breast milk in their freezer) via phone before we book the room, and they confirm providing the service for their guest. It turned out, at check out, the hotel staff did not store our breast milk in the freezer instead they store it in a chiller and as a result our breast milk spoiled and can no longer be used/given to our baby. All the hotel staffs did just say sorry without any explanation, they don't understand how much effort my wife have done to pump that breast milk during our trip. The above was not the only disappointing experiences we had in this hotel.. on the morning when we ready to go for breakfast the electricity suddenly turn off for almost 1 hour.. as a result we must go down to the restaurant from 6th floor using emergency stair. Btw, I have my parent (78 and 65 years old) with me and also a 3 month baby with its stroller. This was a terrible experiences for our family. We also have to eat our breakfast without light.

Delicious fulfilling breakfast with various selection of local traditional dishes. Building is considerably aged but well maintained, and service was good. No convenience store nearby though, hence replenishing daily supplies is an issue."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Victor Abraham,2.0,"Not really bad, cause it only takes a few minutes to Simpang Lima Semarang."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Joris Sodenkamp,2.0,"This hotel was our worst experience in Indonesia. When we arrived everything looked perfect, spacious room and a beautiful pool on the roof terrace. After spending a day in the city we found out that our room was full of cockroaches. Families were crawling up the walls and into our bags. They offered us to move to another room but we couldn't trust that another part of the hotel wasn't the same. We had to unpack everything to make sure that didn't any roaches with us. We decided to move to another clean hotel and requested a full refund. They initially told us that this was not possible but we were persistent and got our money back. We were really disappointed because the price of a room gives the impression that this hotel is more luxurious. Unfortunately this is not the case. However, the front desk agent was really helpful with the refund and the hotel is well located in the city."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rendi Suwardi,2.0,"The room is nice, spacious and clean. However I was disappointed with the elevator, they provide only two elevators and they are small, kinda slow.. If you have that many rooms maybe it is nice to have more elevators, in addition, one time, I have to share the elevator with dirty laundry, isn’t there supposed to be seperate service lift? can’t imagine what will it be like in a peak season when they have full occupancy."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Shelvy Arifin,4.0,"The room is relatively big but their window is small that make the room look smaller. The location is the best, a waling distance to the best culinary experience in Simpsng Lima. And you can have your morning jog right in the centre of the city. The one thing that I don't like is the small parking space. Before I stayed there i have read from other guests about the small parking space. But never thought it was that narrow."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rianda Rizza,4.0,"Perfect stay with a little annoying hiccups. The room was excellent, the staffs are super friendly and helpful. No complain at all. The only issue is their parking space which is worst than a corn field maze. If got a space to part on the higher level, then prepare about 30 to 45 minutes just to get out. It is so cramp, that maneuvering is almost impossible in one shot. If you manage to get out of the parking lot without a scratch, I am sure you can pass TÜV driving license test easily. The crazy traffic outside of the hotel was nothing compared to their parking lot."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rizal Iswara,2.0,"Located in thr heart of Semarang, it has a strategic location. Unfortunately they really need to improve their hotel’s hygiene. The room and bath room was not so neat as I expected on a 4 star hotel. And not to mention the breakfast menu, It was the worst breakfast experience I ever had - small area, hot as well as the taste of the food. Disapointment."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,James M.,2.0,"the bathroom is small, there's no door for the shower. The hotel has very awful hygeine, some 3 stars hotel are better than this, the room is quite big but empty. There's uneven coloring on the wall. The staff is kind and was helpful. There was also bed stains on the bedsheet and pillows. The shower head has molds in it. It also has a quite bad smell in the bathroom. Overall this hotel just needs to improve their hygiene. It was dissappointing. Trash can was full of trash from previous guests. The chair is very rough and pointy. The tv screen was laggy, the fps dropped. Too much dust, I sneezed a lot. AC works fine, spacious enough yet crammed. Would not come here again until the hotel learns how to clean properly."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Andi R,3.0,"Im enjoying my stay for 2 days in semarang with this hotel, located at simpang lime. A very active place during weekend especially with their car free days. As much as i enjoy staying here, i had terrible experience with some of the facilities such as hotel rooms that unable to open due to door malfunction, a dirty swimming pool and squeaking lift. Gratefully theyre able to upgrade my room to bigger space for the room technical issue, the pool is public area with no regulation for people to wash before swim hence so many hair and dirts in the pool. on the other hand, the lift need serious maintenance it squeaking as hell. Their service is exceptional yet id like them to do maintenance and evaluate their facilities"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Sardjito Imam,3.0,"End of July, we stayed on Floor 20, 1BR Studio Connecting - Apartment Louis Kiene Simpang Lima. Room cleanliness and facilities 8 out of 10 - Sheets, pillowcases, mattresses are fragrant and not many spots. TV don't expect much, just local entertainment. - Wall Paper in some places peeling and blotchy. Cleaning and kitchen utensils 6 out of 10 - In the kitchen drawer there is a container for used zinc rust, spots and smells as well as a lot of small animals, sticky pan and spatula are not suitable for use) Cleanliness and bathroom facilities 7 out of 10 - Bathroom Facilities 6 out of 10 (Hot water only lasts 1 minute of use) Many bathroom flies enter the room and kitchen, it is recommended to bring fly and mosquito spray Parking 5 of 10 - Included in the category of the most dangerous apartment for SUV car operators and above, because access to the ramp down and up the car park must be accompanied by a parking attendant, the distance between the wall and the car body is only in the range of 5 - 6 CM left and right with minimal maneuvering, It is not recommended for Beginner drivers and SUV units with a wider and longer body than the 2020 Toyoya KIjang Innova Reborn. - Parking lot is good, enough space between cars to park. The best facilities are in the swimming pool ares, the best view to see the city of Semarang is more than 180 degrees, comfortable, clean and homey seats."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Mariana Diah Rahmawati,1.0,"I am extremely dissapointed with the service of this hotel. I have booked and fully paid last night, but because of the traffic jam from Jakarta to Semarang, we were exhausted. So we had to sleep at a rest area, and we had to take breakfast first. We already called the hotel at around 10.00 am, saying that we needed the room to take refreshment only. The front office said that it's ok, checkout can be arranged at 1.00 pm. But when I finally arrived at the hotel at around 12.40 pm, a front office receptionist named Winda said that my room was already checked out automatically at 12.00 pm. I said I already called and was told that it's ok. How can they give my room (210) to another person? No good answer from the front office. I was really dissapointed. We were really tired and exhausted, and were denied a little hospitality. In the end, we had to book another hotel near by."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Adi Dbgad,4.0,"Close to Simpang Lima Which is the Centre of Semarang. The parking is very tight, must be very careful to park the car. TV program needs more adjustment, since many channels are broken. Rooms: Small but quite roomy."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Amanda Putri,5.0,"You must try staying on this hotel, when you are traveling in Semarang. The room is neat and VERY SPACIOUS (which I love it!). The bathroom is very clean, even they're not that big (which is fine for me). The hotel is very close with Simpang Lima too. I heard the parking area isn't that good, so you can ask for the valet service, it's free when you're staying there. Overall, stayed in this hotel was a great experience for me!"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Herynda Cempaka,4.0,"business hotel with great interior, but it hard to bring a big luggage because you need to use stairs on lobby"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,emiru hamdee,4.0,"nice hotel to stay with your love ones. the rooms are a little bit small but very cozy, good lighting, clean and fresh beds, nice carpets, good view and so on. the staffs were fine, i have been on a better services. the breakfast were okay. the only thing bother me was how small is the dining area was. and beware that the parking space are pretty narrow for large cars. but there is some parking staff assistance that help you on the tight spots to get you through. i am using a 1,7m wide 4,3m long 1,5m tall suv gets kinda tight on the corners. good luck!"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Vincent Yongky,3.0,"Location was super strategic at the middle of famous Simpang Lima. Service was also good, quick check in and quick out. Staff was kind, Security was quick respons. What makes me give 3-stars was the flow of their parking lot, it gives me headache everytime i park my car there, super small, super difficult to getting through, and lotsa scratch on the wall comes from previous car that didn't get through this super difficult parking way, fortunately they give standby-man to guide us whether to park the car or getting out from the building, but still, its so hard to park the car here."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Ilham Sandri Koto,4.0,"The standard 4-star hotel, as same as LK Pandanaran but a little bit different here. The hotel lift is located on B1, not near receptionist (just the apartment lift near receptionist). For the food is just standard here like LK Pandanaran but the breakfast space here is slightly narrower than LK Pandanaran The parking space is also slightly narrower than LK Pandanaran but it has 5 parking floors too. But if you’re looking for the hotels close to the ‘Simpang Lima Semarang’ may be it can be the one of the hotels to stay and according to your specified budget."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Maria Ursula,4.0,"Pretty pool, love it! But the car parking track was a bit extreme for an amateur, too narrow and small."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Minggus Tan,4.0,"Should have been a 5 star except for the parking.

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Frisco Pratama,2.0,"if you bring medium to big car to Semarang, better you reconsider to choose this hotel since the parking lot really really tricky for manuver your car. and it's quite surprise that the operator for this tricky parking only one pic and many of security officer but not doing anything to help him. thankfully the parking officer quite nice and helpful. but for the location since really close with simpang lima, yes it was quite nice to have a morning walking around simpang lima."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,eyo,3.0,"+ - friendly reception - good location - friendly staffs - Limited choice breakfast Inconvenience breakfast room Limited parking space unless you got driver with you Please renew the linen and duvet, they are dull"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Cliff Gerardo,2.0,"I did not expect the second iteration I visited of the LK Hotels in Semarang had: SLOW & unbearable checkin, NO temperature controlled lobby, little help with luggage from staff, limited seating areas that are socially distanced. The rooms are so small for what they’re charging. Keep in mind we’re staying at the hotel— not the apartments. But still, the staff seemed hesitant to operate quickly and smoothly. VERY unprofessional! Have a big car? PARKING IS AN ISSUE— inhumane unfriendly car park is bound to at least get 2 scratches or dings on your precious automobile. THINK WISELY before booking this place or just don’t bring a car"

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Auting The Explorer,3.0,"The hotel's location is quite strategic in front of the ""Simpang lima"" intersection, but not in accordance with 4-star facilities. The parking space is narrow, you have to be a good driver to park here. It is not recommended for those who bring their own vehicle. The hotel lobby is hot, the restaurant is not up to 4 star standards. There is nothing to expect on the 2 star breakfast menu even though they want to deliver breakfast to the room. The condition of the room is quite clean, the AC is cold and the bed is comfortable."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,ade tri saputra,4.0,"The hotel was good, clean, and I love the pool very much, but the bathroom is very small.

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,merlin hutagalung,4.0,"A 4stars hotel located in simpang lima semarang. The location is very strategic, right in the middle of city. Close to airport, old cities, sam poo khong, business center, government center and culinary center. It has a rooftop swimming pool, the view from that pool is the best. The room is small, and their ceiling is very low. Almost hit my head. Hot water is good and room cleaness is standard. Parking lot is very limited, not recommended if you bring your own car. Breakfast is poor. Limited menu, and the menu is always the same everyday and many of the food is cold. Stay for 3 nights."

We got woken up at midnight due to payment method issue (3rd party app), which was resolved in the morning. Unprofessional, it's should not be the customer's problem if you are unable to manage your accounting/booking system."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Vida Parady,4.0,"Great location, but the apartment staff needs to be more helpful and friendly. The apartment reception looks messy and dirty. The parking space is out of this world: DO NOT park here unless you want to try your skills on how to turn in an extremely narrow turns while going up and down"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Olivia OliveTree,4.0,"Stayed thers for a day. Place is strategic, but the entrance is not friendly. Hotel guest must go down by stair to access the elevator in the rear, which is ineffective since we are bringing our luggage. Parking space at the building is not comfortable, too narrow, I saw many vehicles got scratch there. Hotel room is pretty good. Pretty clean. Breakfast is not available during PPKM. Pool has outstanding view. But they are lack of lights, they say it open until 9 pm, but around 6 pm, pool area is very very extremely dark. No staff or pool guard at all. I have to travel down to ground wearing towel to ask for light."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,P,2.0,"Extremely dirty, bathrooms are too small, not worth the price. Very dissapointed"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,rendra ren b,4.0,"maybe because this pandemic so the elevator only 1 can be use so u must wait little bit long ,and the parking area is very small must have a good skill , the hotel is good and comfortable"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Daniel,3.0,"I wouldn't necessarily call this a luxury hotel. Yes, it's well located, just right by Simpang Lima, the heart of the city. Rooms are spacious and quite comfy. However, walls are thin, and it's not well maintained and there are spots that need to be better cleaned around the premise. If breakfast is not included in your fare, don't bother. The breakfast is very limited (space and the menu), it's a lot better to have breakfast in other restaurant nearby."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Jessica Tampi,3.0,Room is very nice. Clean. Neat and tidy. Big king size bed as requested. But unfortunately the parking lot is too narrow and now representing 4star hotel at all. Also lobby too hot & access to hotel only using 2 lifts that connect to parking lot.

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Novan WP,3.0,"1. Affordable price, good price for staying at midtown. 2. Rooms are require minor maintenance and need to be improved. 3. Good roof top view. Night view is the best...sunset is great. 4. Small space for parking area, tiny space for car park manuvers. 5. Toilet water pressure is great...hot water good. Aircond is good. 6. Bed sheet and towel looks old."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Anisa Bahar,3.0,"The room and bed are spacious. Great. Small parking lot. But we used the Valet Service. the bumper of my car is dented. the scratch is very large. but they didn’t want to admit their mistake, even when we ask for their CCTV footage. Not recommended for guests carrying lots items or large suitcases, access to the hotel lift is a bit far and must pass through the stairs while no officers are ready to help And The Bellboy services were taking too long. The Front Desk Officer was busy taking phone and other stuff while I was talking to her 👎🏻 Overall for me staying at this hotel quite pleasant but if there is a chance to stay there again, ABSOLUTE BIG NO NO."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,sebastio achmad,2.0,It's just not like the name where tempting to stay. Wondering it was so luxurious and outstanding. But it's truly beyond from the expectations. Building is like an old need so many maintenance. AC didn't work well at the lobby also inside room. Restaurant is so tiny with less variant and bad taste. Parking is trouble with small space row. Hospitality is ok from the staff.
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Drady Mica Oryza Bagaswara,4.0,"+ Nice room & spacey (Children can play well). + Modern concept. + Strategic place in midtown near Simpang Lima & Shopping Center. + Don't have to worry about what would we ate on lunch nor dinner, there are a lot of street food around the hotel & Simpang Lima. + On roof top, there's a quite big swimming pool within edge of the building wall so we could see the midtown's wide view. + In room deposit box, water boiler & mini fridge available. - Very limited (narrow) space to turning in parking lot. - Elevators are often ""warm"" (even I can described it as ""hot"") due no AC inside. - To access the hotel room, we need to use stairs to B1 which is no slope/slide floor to bring case etc. (the elevator right in front of receptionist only accessed to W/R apartment which is it still same building with the hotel, only different section). - A lot of dirt under the bed, housekeeper need to more often to clean it up."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,jusman hutama,4.0,"Strategic location, within walking distance to Alun-alun Simpang Lima. Unfortunately, parking ramp very small. Large sedan (Accord, Camry, E-Class) and big MPV (Alphard) definitely cannot park in the garage. Service is ok. No complain yet."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rima Wahyuningsih,2.0,"Disappointed with the service. Also the lift is very inconvenient for parking and apartment. The parking area is too small. I feel like the architect is failed to build a proper parking space. It's better for you to book grab if you stay here if you rent a car confirm your car will got scratch. Only the building looks grand luxury. But really sucks for me. Also the apartment sink has very strong odors that makes me need to cover the hole when i don't use. The breakfast also not worth IDR 100K for those food, and majority of the food taste too salty."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,irwan garniwan,3.0,"Hotel design, lobby design and room design are terrific.

We can hear people chattering and knocking at other rooms clearly. -my friend lost her bag (goodie bag) with lots of souvenirs inside. -no guards at swimming pool. Consider this is a 4 star hotel, i think its not worth it to pay 1mio++ with those poor facilities and service."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Yvonne Widjojo,3.0,"A strategic location, modern new building. Clean room and comfortable beds, but unstable shower temperature. Beautiful top floor swimming pool overlooking simpang lima. Think again if you travelling with big cars. The parking space are limited and the ramps are only suitable for small cars."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Inne Hadiati,3.0,"A functional hotel near Simpang Lima. What I like about this hotel is I have a nice view overlooking Simpang Lima. The room is nice and clean but for the pillow I wish I will have a better pillow. Bathroom amenities are very minimise. The towel is very poor, old and do not match compared to the hotel condition. I wish I have a better towel. I dont like the entrance toward the lift to the room. This hotel do not have a nice lobby and they don't serve a good breakfast."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Randy Chandra,3.0,"The room is not so big, not entirely clean, the lobby is very hot, the AC in the room also not working properly, the breakfast has a small number of options. One positive side is the location which is in the center of Semarang."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Khairul Anwar,4.0,"Here for the Ramadhan breakfasting. The food choice is quite limited but tasty. The rooftop swimming pool is indeed awesome, not too big but great view. Location is just perfect. Parking lot is scary, they even have the anti-scratch on each corner and I saw there are lots of scars over there. Try it of you think you are an expert on driving & parking. Lol."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Pitta Sekar Wangi,5.0,"Wow!!! I like the room. It's big and confinient. And the picture I posted here, is the rooftop. They have swimming pool on top of the building. The staff said that we can watch and enjoy both sunrise and sunset there. I would come back here cause the location's just perfect too!"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Nida ul hasanah,3.0,"Nice 4 stars hotel. No doubt for the facility. But it kind of complicated access. You have to change lift twice for breakfast and walk about 70m. And you have to go to the ground level fisrt from 23rd floor (swimming pool and gym) to 9th floor (my room) and ask receptionist, didnt bring card access because still used by my friend at room. They only gave us one access card for 2 persons."

Staff product knowledge very bad, Need more training to improve 6. Not variable for bfast menu, No staff incharge, No refill for food and serving, No tastes of food all is Plain 7. 1 think better is rooftop pool area, restaurant and staff very nice"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Yulianto H Santoso,4.0,"- room is not large, but quite comfort. Especially the bed, like it. - bathroom is quite small. The shower room has no door or even a curtain. So the water were splashing out of the shower room. - if you ask someone to pick you up, better stand by at the lobby before they come, so they don't have to wait for too long at the drop off poin, which has a very limited space. - strategic location, near Simpang Lima. Very easy to find mall, if you like, and many choices of food nearby."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,hendrik kuncoro,5.0,"I love this hotel so much except their escalator, because there are only 2 small escalator and it takes time for you to waith the lift since they have 23 floor. Oh ya, i also have a hard time to find the parck space because it has small space and fully booked also because apartment and hotel use the same park slot. The road to reach the parking slot so small that makes you have to be really 2 be careful when drive.. But i love the room because it is so big and my hotell room's view is simpang lima😁. The pool on the rooftop also great, wish can comeback in the future."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,kian wee chau,4.0,The location is good for photographing Semarang city. 23 floors in total. The facility is well maintained. The only downside is that there are staircases from hotel lobby to hotel lifts. Not convenient if you have big luggage.

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Ika Hapsari,3.0,"I've been dreaming to have one night staycation in this hotel becuse this hotel looks so luxurious and modern. It's located in the centre of Semarang, near Simpang Lima. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with their service. First, we had to wait too long only for check in with a limited couch around the lobby (means we had to stand up). Second, when we were about to enter our room, voila! It's actually somebody else's room. Double booked because of system error. Luckily we hadn't open the door because the room's owner was coming in the perfect timing as we were. And the staff didn't fixed the messed up condition quickly. I don't think to book this hotel anymore"

We will be back there again if we go back to have family holiday in Semarang for sure"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,joko muslim,2.0,"This hotel has advantage in location, however the services need to be improved. As hotel with 5 stars, the reception staffs are lack of initiative to serve and hospitality also need to be improved. The air conditioning in the room can’t be controlled which I felt too chilling. Breakfast is the only best part of this hotel with fast responses staffs. Foods are good and various from western to local. The room are clean with electric water boiler. Complementary mineral drinks were plenty with several tea bags, instant coffee, creamer and sugar. Facilities operate at during daytime and close early, not really suitable for those whose finish work at night. When I arrived at the hotel with motor cycle Gojek, we are not allowed to stop at the main entrance, this felt discriminated.😓😓😓 I did stay there eventually."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Marolop Pardede,3.0,"first time staying at this hotel, the lobby looks clean, smells good, the lighting is good. going up to the room floor, getting out of the elevator was greeted by a musty smell, the smell of damp. my room the impression is also not pleasant. smelly pillow, shower can't be rotated. for a 5-star hotel, the breakfast menu is below my expectations. maybe this will be the first and last experience staying here."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Jessica Natania,5.0,"Great place to stay. The room is spacious and the bathroom as well. Breakfast is good, a lot of variants included the famous lumpia semarang, nasi goreng babat, babat gongso, and soto semarang. Tried those foods earlier from the famous stall, but Gumaya’s is way better. One thing that’s slightly missing for me is their service. In breakfast time, they didn’t help to find table (the situation is crowded and I almost didn’t get a table) or even offer tea/coffee as it’s the most default service they should have. But overall, it was a pleasant stay which I would definitely pay another visit."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Wee Lee GOH,4.0,Services were super good from front desk and the gate counter. I think previously other people complain and they made big improvement. Enable to speak good English is a plus! I am impressed that they call me up for any comments and help I need. Gate counter help to ensure my grab was well received. Superb! The breakfast is famous which later I heard from my supplier. It offer full range of traditional Central Java food. Indeed is traditional with intestine food provide.However I can not appreciate the traditional Kueh which is too hard for me. I book delux king room. The room is huge but look really old to me. I thought they just renovated. They provide total 6 bottles mineral water which I greatly appreciated What could be better if the swimming pool can close at later time like 9pm would be great.

It would be perfect if they served ice cream. Service was awesome. Of course there was a certain lady that took care of room checking during breakfast that sometimes got on your nerves... I drove my own car, and parking was nice. The basement was kinda tight for big SUVs. The rooms were very good. Smells so nice. AC was cold and comfy. The beds need replacement soon because it bent so much when you woke up in the morning. Bathroom was perfect👍👍👍. Would definitely come back here 😍"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Arvin Tanu,5.0,This is NOBLE COURT review. A restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. I really loves this small chinese resto. Taste very good and their menu are different from regular chinese resto. I tried their fried thousand year egg. It was great. Then their xiaolungbao. Their skin was too soft. But tasted very good as well. Their price is not that expensive as well. Very affordable. Overall such an underrated place.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,farida rokhmawati,3.0,"Great location Hotel, Good Food but Disappointed by the hospitality of the receptionist This hotel is located near a lot of shopping center. The room was clean, spacious and the food from the restaurant quite good. After our check out, I asked politely a favor to one the receptionist to take a picture of us on the lobby as a souvenir and she looked weirdly at me then said “a moment”. Her expression made me upset then I asked to a waiter that was in front of the restaurant to help me and that waiter with a big smile took a picture of us. So I would like to say thank you so much for that waiter and please give some hospitality training to that receptionist. If she was not available or maybe don’t want to help, she can try at least to control her expression in front of the guest."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Miranti Rachmatsaleh,2.0,"Room is spacious but very disappointed with the hotel management. No crowd control during breakfast ended up with long queue, and no options to bring the food to the room. Breakfast area is very crowded which left lots of concern about safety during covid time.

And for water lovers, this hotel provides 6 bottles of 600mL mineral water every day as a complement. Our second day at Gumaya Tower, I got a call from Yessy, the hotel staff, who asked if there were any problems we experienced during our stay. For us, this attention is extraordinary.

Food in skylounge was also not good steak I ordered was cold and the food we ordered cam out not all together but in two servings. For the amount of money I pay for one night , over 4 million idr, it is certainly not worth it. Found the staff not interested with the guests. Not once we were asked if everything was OK. Even at the checking out the receptionist didn't even ask how our stay was and if we enjoyed staying in their hotel. Will not be going back for sure, there are much better hotels to stay in semarang and for a much better and fairer price."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,hendro mulyo,5.0,"Room is nice and clean, hot water is sufficient. But, breakfast and food over all is not as good as rooms. And staff hospitality to guest should be improved, a lot"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Lana Nurdewi,5.0,The room (deluxe twin) is quite spacious even with an extra bed. The room facilities all work well and well maintained. The most important is the location. It's in the heart of Semarang.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Philippe Auberger,1.0,"Smoking room. Super hold. Holes on the carpet. Exhausted furniture. A no go.Went to their skyline restaurant, fine dining.....a real joke. Despite friendly staff the rest is just a disaster. Frozen vegies amd fries. Anyway first and last."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Henry Harlim,5.0,The hotel services was very good. Room are so big. Will be stay again here next time.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ira Wardhani,5.0,"Modern and nice hotel for family vacation. The room is quite spacious, with separate shower and bath tub. Check in process is quite sufficient, the receptionist was asking for our rapid test's paper due to covid 19 (which we don't mind at all) so the hotel guests can stay in this hotel safe and comfortable."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Adri Kharismanto,5.0,"One of the best hotel in Semarang. Rooms are nice, staffs are friendly, the gym almost felt like professional, and breakfast is outstanding."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Michael Darmawan,5.0,"As this is my 2nd experience to be in Semarang. I can say that this hotel is very strategic, especially to experience many culinary spots (online or on the spot). With great service and very clean accomodation, I am sure to go back here again on my future visit to Semarang."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Cliff Gerardo,5.0,"Lovely hotel, well, it SHOULD be as Semarang’s best 5 star hotel. Got checked-in quickly, trip to my room was fast and efficient because of their 4 elevators. My room was pretty clean. Carpets are not though, but I can still get by it. They provide a lot of amenities in the bathroom which is always a great thing. Bath tub was clean too. Let’s not forget beds. They have the comfiest beds I’d argue. Staff since I walked through the door were very helpful and friendly If I do say so myself. Although the Cascade restaurant was closed for renovations during my visit. I still enjoyed the food they served in the Polaris Room 3rd floor. Pool and Gym was great! 5 stars from me!"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Tania Pratiwi,3.0,"For the room very clean and comfortable, the amenities are complete. Loved it. The only one that bothers me is breakfast time. Cause the ballroom and one of the restaurants is under maintaining, so the breakfast move to 3rd floor and it's a really small capacity and easy to full, so we are directed to 2nd floor, their backup place for breakfast. The foods have not many variants just like the 3rd floor, and the staff is careless and there is no clear signage where when the elevator is open. Really disappointed 🙁"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Raditya Bagoes,3.0,Tolerable place for a 5 star hotel. The room was spacious and the bathroom was great. But there was a coffee stain in the table. I dont bother with the stain but for a 5 star hotel it was questionable. The food also just okay. We order nasi goreng babat for dinner and nothing special. At breakfast they give me ramen with udon noodles. When i ask for chilli flakes they give me sambal from bakso? How come you mix ramen and sambal bakso. Lol.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Halim Ashari,3.0,Poor hotel SOP. They have very friendly and polite staffs but because the SOP is somewhat muddled they look bad. We ask for an extra bed and we were asked to pay first before they can send the bed. We have already lodged our credit card as payment guarantee. That's not 5 star service. My first experience when staying at this so call 5 star hotel.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ruth Novita,5.0,"very affordable for 5 star hotel. the price in the menu are includes tax and service. close order for beverages is at 11pm, and drinks is at 11.30pm"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Nikki Liem,5.0,"Have stayed here twice and I think the next time we go to Semarang again, will surely stay here again! Staff were undoubtedly helpful and friendly. Room was spacious, 6 bottles of mineral water (2 were cold in the mini fridge!). Water kettle was almost broken but still functional on my second stay. Room and the hotel was very clean, hand sanitizer easy to access. Felt very safe here during pandemic. The bottom of our shoes were sprayed upon arrival. During breakfast service, staff can be seen actively helping guests and cleaning up. Food was awesome. Ordered oxtail soup and macncheese to our room and they came fast, very tasty (did not taste like ""hotel food"" but more like home cooking, even the bfast food too!). Thanks so kuch Gumaya Tower hotel, can't wait to stay there again!"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Saiful Anam,5.0,"After 2 years, I am back here. It looks more luxury after being renovated. Far different and improved. The breakfast was also so good. The covid protocol was implemented here. Even, the security sprayed your shoe sole as if the virus brought under your shoe LOL...good job. It made me feel more comfort and secure."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ardy Prasetya,5.0,"The place is nice, neat and comfortable. The room, lounge, restaurant, and other facilities are in very good condition. The airport pickup is perfect. Just a little minor on some interior decorative panels at the corridor in our room floor which look broken. But the service is very good. A nearly perfect place to stay."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Tommy Setiawan,5.0,"Good location, nice staff and comfort room."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Nadia Bianca,5.0,"The lobby has high ceilling and gives off luxurious feeling. The room was great even though it cam be quite pricey. Do try the ""club"" type of room (located only in level 15-17) as it gave free access to the lounge in each floor. You'll got free beer or soda with some other condiments for snacks. The swimming pool, spa and fitness were great and the food taste very good too !"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Aris B Nugroho,4.0,"The spacious room with friendly design and staff has made us feel at home. However, it is necessary to improve the management of car parking and facilities for drivers. In addition, breakfast variations need to be changed every day, because three days of staying with the same breakfast menu will be boring."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Gustiyan Mahardika,5.0,"Good room good food, definitely would recommend going here with my family"

Gumaya Tower Hotel,IRENE TOBING,4.0,"Luxurious 5 star hotel. Since we came bring our family and little children, compare to other 5 stars hotel, in my opinion the breakfast menu need more variation. Especially on weekend.Stay here by the end of August, kehabisan lumpia (khas Semarang) waktu sarapan & nggak ada cake & kue basah. :)"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Mikhael Garda Prasetya,5.0,"I will come back for the food for sure! Excellent taste meet the restaurant's elegance. However, their hospitality is amazing, they have warm and kind staff to welcome. Last, their basement area need more improvement, bc once I went there, it felt gloomy and dark."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Andrew Kurniadi,5.0,This is one of the best hotel in Semarang. The service is really good and the room is clean and bright. The breakfast buffet was top notch. They offer great selections and they even serves sweet martabak along with pancakes for breakfast 😁. They offer free shuttle to the airport. Just ask the concierge for it. Gumaya hotel really deserves 5 star hotel rating.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Noviana Setiawati,5.0,Very nice place to stay when you're in Semarang. They have tremendous breakfast with lots of yummy menus.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Bobby Sumarkho,4.0,Pleasant hotel in the heart of Semarang. The room quite spacious with cozy design & tone. It's quiet & well maintained. Bed & pillows comfortable. Bathroom has both shower & bathtub. I notice pool did not provide towels so some children walked into hotel wetting the floor & elevator.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Agatha Claudia,5.0,"Location : very strategic, within walking distance to some famous culinary destination Room : no complaint, very spacious, bathroom clean spacious, bed are comfy, amenities everything fit the description of 5 star hotel. Service is great, fast. They have many facilities, swimming pool but not too wide, fitness center with spa and sauna, they also provide shoes in case you use sandals. Price compare to Jakarta, ofc it's very affordable , if you visit Semarang and you wanted to stay in an affordable 5 star hotel, this is it"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,my TaRaka,5.0,"Realy amazed with the details. They arranged a diferent tile in the bathroom, unslipery for the shower room, comfort bathtub, lots of mineral water to drink (they gave 6 bottles). They even put the information on the lamps buttons, so I dont have to klick it many times, guessing which button for wich lamps. The room is cozy, bright and spacious. The hospitality is great. Food are amazing, lots of choises and it taste good. Gym and the pool were quite good. Surely will coming back here."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Tomi Satryatomo,5.0,"One of the best places to stay in Semarang, especially if you need to be close to the downtown area. Only take a few minutes to walk to the famous Simpang Lima, the iconic roundabout considered as the center of Semarang, with the mystical Lawang Sewu (a thousand doors) building on one of the sides. The room is neatly arranged, the bed is comfortable, the breakfast is nice and the service is superb. Everything you could expect from a 5 stars hotel. The only downside is the swimming pool which length is only about 5 meters. Due to the pandemic, the hotel implements strict regulations. Mask is expected to be worn at all times. In the restaurant, you're not allowed to take the food by yourself. Someone is always ready to cater to your need. Tables and chairs are put at a distance."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Binod Ojha,5.0,"Nice hotel with the good services by hotel staff. Easy to reach mall and food. A lots of variety food in the breakfast but it more to local food which is not really international buffet. They serve buffet for the dinner on Friday and Saturday with reasonable price and delicious. So you should try it. The problem is only to go to GF Lobby, you have to change 2 lift the reach there."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,rasta chok,5.0,"Spacious room. Clean. For 5 star hotels if possible replace tea bags that are a little classy. There is no hairdryer in the bathroom. The breakfast menu is varied, delicious, coffee uses a machine so you can ask for cappuccino etc. Recommended 👍"

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Sahala Harahap,5.0,"Nice and clean room, good selection of menu on breakfast buffet, attentive service. They provide free 6 bottles of mineral water in the room (usually only 2). Be careful when order room service though! I ordered oxtail fried rice, only to find I can't eat it because it's too sweet, and too oily."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Ika Hapsari,5.0,"The most luxurious hotel in Semarang city. Located in a very strategic area in Gajahmada street that is super accessible from the city center. I haven't try to stay here, only try their iftar menu in their ballroom. They provide such a complete menu for iftar with understandable price. No wonder that this hotel has 5 stars label. Like any other city style hotel, they don't have a wide area of courtyard that make it a bit crowded when there is an event inside attended by many guests. The interior design is also modern and luxurious. The room rate is fair according to the season"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,David Teck Chin,5.0,A high end hotel within the sleepy city of Semarang. I enjoyed my stay here and the value for money for the quality of the rooms was good. The staff were attentive and their restaurants were pretty good. Buffet was really cheap and offered a fair amount of choice from various cuisines. Location is near the famous weekend night market which houses a huge number of stalls for street food within their little chinatown. It is also near Paragon Mall. Overall can't fault much for the price of the rooms at which I got mine for.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Bruce Hanadi,4.0,"This hotel is located near downtown, only 5 minutes drive to the alun-alun simpang 5 or lawang sewu area. The room was large, and clean and the bathroom was equipped with bathtub for the standard room. Breakfast was good, they have quite selection of domestic food.Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"

Staff are so welcome and friendly. Hotel is very clean. Hotel room is very modern and good design. Hopefully for tommorow breakfast I expect the best experience also. Best luck for you.
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Prasetyo Utomo,5.0,"New hotel, clean and spacious.. Good price/rate, free breakfast"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Chris Gsb,4.0,Nice and cozy
Gumaya Tower Hotel,D K,2.0,"Seems do not deserve to be called a 5 star hotel. The facilities and attention to detail does not reflect a true 5 star hotel. See pictures for reference. The worst part of it all...hairdryer cable blew when my wife was using it. It sparked some fire with smoke while tripping the circuit breaker. My wife's finger got burned and she felt a little numb on her affected hand. Hairdryer has no brand, look and feels cheap! Hotel apologized, and sent a small cake as a sign of apology. I think this hotel still got potential to better. My room pros are, cold air con, quite comfy bed, ,,, 6 free bottle water everyday..."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Gagah Gautama,5.0,"Good at all, especially for the many choices of breakfast and it all was very delicious. Clean room and all facilities, but the swimming pool just standard maybe because it's not a brand new hotel. Overall satisfied and would come back again"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Catur Wibowo,5.0,"This hotel is excellent. It was my first experience of staying in this hotel, and I have a great experience. From arrival, checking in till departure, all are great. Thanks"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,buyung mahendra,5.0,"This is a five star hotel in semarang. The room is big enough and standard facility. But there are a bathtub in every room i guess. Because of covid, you actually can eat every dish in the restaurant but cant serve your selve. No problem cause every dish is tasty."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Andy Wijaya,5.0,"Going to bukber event at Marquess. My favorite so far is chicken quesadillas, beef wellington, balinese grilled fish, chicken satay, and their sushi is also nice. I never found a delicious sushi in an all you can eat scenery. My last praise goes to their mendoan / fried tempeh. Very crisp and salty makes me reach for it for the 2nd time 😅"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Jess Lam,5.0,"Location is in center of town though no shopping mall in walking distance. However, with the availability of grab taxis in the city, there is no transportation problem at all to visiting the big malls in town. Big room, spacious bathroom and great breakfast, although a little crowded during the Muslim Holidays week. I love this place."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Lumi Loo,3.0,"Decent size rooms for a 5 star hotel outside the capital. Prices are fine, BEWARE that the hotel only assigns ONE floor for smokers. Receptionist claims that you've to call ahead and confirm, yet my room was denied to me even after a verbal confirmation of availability. There was no upgrades or compensation offered, but the hotel moved us to a smoking room the next day. They've also managed to lose a charger of mine during the room transfer. If you insist on a local experience, go for it, but this hotel won't be my first choice on the list. I've had better experience with other hotels in the area. (Crowne was a significantly better experience, not sure about its current state after they changed management to PO hotels.)"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,George Adriaansz,4.0,"This new hotel might be the best among other hotels in Semarang city. The building was new, the front desk staffs are friendly and responsive, there were four lifts to serve the hotel guest uo and down, the breakfast room was spacious and offered various menus to satisfy our taste buds. The room was spacious, well furnished, and amenities were complete and good. No restaurants surround this hotel that could reach walkable, so the guests had two options to have dinner, go to hotel restaurant or go to other redtaurants by taxi or on line rental vehicle"
