Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Melyanti Liando,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel Twice. The first was on 9-10 January 2022 and the second was on 28-30 July 2022. Room is spacious, got 2 beds. Breakfast is delicious, many variation of food. The gym facilities is good, the equipment is complete and clean. The meeting room is good The lobby also very cozy. Want to back here soon...."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,F Paul,5.0,"We enjoyed our stay here. The room is not as big as some 5 stars hotels in Java but it's very comfortable. The only difficulty I had was trying to adjust the room air conditioning. Swimming pool is nice but the breakfast buffet by the pool takes the cake. There are so many options, including Semarang specialties. I wish I could try everything! Food were laid out well and staff were accommodating."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Cynthia Isabella,5.0,"Two months ago, I stayed at Tentrem Hotel Semarang with my family. When we first arrived, we were immediately greeted by the bellboy, who also carried our suitcases. Then, at check-in time, we were served quickly, so we didn't have to wait too long, and after that, we were escorted immediately to our room. At night, we ordered food at the hotel via the telephone. It didn't take a long time for the food to arrive in our room. The next morning, when I had breakfast at the hotel, the waiters there greeted me with a friendly greeting and immediately escorted us to an empty seat. Then, the waiter also offered coffee or tea, and it was brought directly to our table. During our 4 days there, we were served in a professional and friendly manner. Their professionalism and great service made us want to go back there."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Karel K. Himawan,5.0,"The hotel that gives you a one of a kind experience! Unlike most 5-stars hotels, you can experience their authenticity in every corner of the hotel. They provide jamu and other traditional drinks in the mini bar. Semarang authentic food were provided in breakfast. Location is strategically located quite close to the heart of the city, but far enough to avoid hustle bustle of the city."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Francois Barbe,5.0,"First class service in a first class way. A real five stars hotel with all the amenities you dream of. Beds are soft, we sleep great. Staff at the pool or the restaurant is very helpful and friendly. A super memory for all our family.Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Winny Rachmani,5.0,"Our stay at Hotel Tentrem was the best decision. The room is excellent. Bed is spacious (for 2 adults and 2 children). I love the view from our room (It's the iconic swimming pool). Breakfast is amazing, especially if you are into local's food."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amelia,5.0,"One of the newest hotel in Semarang. A luxury hotel with traditional touch throughout, classy, elegant with characters. Staff are friendly and attentive. Great breakfast selections as they include many traditional semarang + Javanese foods. We will be back for sure."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Indra Nafi,5.0,"It was one of luxurious hotels in Semarang which offered the guests with convenient services. The location was strategic, the room was comfortable and super completed, and it's equipped with a shopping mall and an apartment. The breakfast menus are tasteful. Everyone enjoyed their meals, including special menus from local semarang food and beverage. However, the price for a night was a bit expensive because it made sense with the quality of service. Thank you."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,ony,4.0,"Hotel lobby is luxury, big as five star hotel standard. They prepare welcome drink. We should wait 20 minutes to get the room key after check in. Average size room for that price, I think the room is smaller compare to other five star hotel in Jakarta or Yogja with same price. Toilet amenities are complete. Breakfast food menus and taste are standar. This hotel connected to Tentrem mall. So you can easy find food or cafe for lunch or dinner."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riska Mordiana,5.0,"Great room, amazing lobby, wide variations in breakfast (western, eastern, original Semarang foods, pastries and... Ice cream!). The location is good, near Simpang Lima area. Great services from everyone too :)Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Bobby Wibisono Wijaya,5.0,"I would like to recommend this place. The room was nice with all of the complementary of mini bar that free of charges. And what i really love is the breakfast staff at resto kayu manis specially zainal. Well most of the food contain sugar. I did mention to him about my diabetic issue and he really ask me about what kind of food i have to avoid, and ask the kitchen prepare it for me. Shout out to Zainal for taking care of me."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,I love Food,4.0,"The rooms are spacious, clean, and very pretty. Although some of the paintings dod freak me out. Staff were very friendly. What stood out to me most is the breakfast! They had a variety of cuisine from all across the globe, and also local Semarang food. It was the highlight of my stay. For the pool, meh. It felt very awkward swimming in front of people having breakfast. There's no seperation fence/plants, so people could easily come in and out of the breakfast place to the pool. The outdoor breakfast area and the pool is so uncomfortably close. But it's alright. The beautiful tile art in the pool made up for it. The water felt very fresh and nice, didn't feel oddly chemical ish like some pools do. It's across Tentrem mall and very near citraland so you have a variety of food choices near walking distance. There's lots of local street food near the hotel too. My stay at Tentrem Jogja was a 5/5 but I would give Tentrem Semarang a 4/5."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Samuel Lumentut,4.0,"This is the most expensive hotel in Semarang. One group with Hotel Tentrem Jogja and Hotel Chanti not far from Hotel Tentrem Semarang. Own by Sido Muncul, the company who produces the world famous Tolak Angin brand. So where to start? Is it luxurious? You bet, service? Excellent, location? Almost all Semarang legendary foods are located within 15 to 20 minutes drive from the hotel which is Godsend. Breakfast? Although the international menus were a bit boring, they have stalls of more than 10 legendary Semarang food like Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Gudeg Abimanyu, Asem Asem Koh Lim and many other. Oh don't forget to try their tolak angin ice cream. Its... Well ice cream with tolak angin taste... Literally. Its weird at first but its good the more you eat it. Pool also really great. Not too big but on 1 side they have transparent acrylic so it is so unique and cool to take photo at. The hotel is also connected directly to Tentrem mall. Upscale mall with not so many tenants but they have Ice Skating and cinema inside. They also have big aquarium with Arapaima fish native from Amazon river. Its great really. Alfamart is also like 25 steps away literally from hotel lobby should you want to buy water to stock into your room. Just perfect. So why 4 stars? Well.. Room is okay, aircon is cold. Bathroom also okay although the room that I stayed have no bathup. They have electric window that can be transparent or iced so you can't see inside. Pretty cool. The drapes are all provided by Serba Antik. The lifts also very high tech and basically has no button inside them. You push it outside the elevator where you wanna go. Very cool. They also give free minibar stocked with Sido Muncul products for you to try. So again why 4 stars? At this price I think the room should be a bit bigger, have bathup and fully carpeted. Granted they use some kind of marbles or Granite for the flooring, but for me personally plush carpet still make me feel like I'm in a 5 stars hotel instead of marbles or granite. The floor is cold to the touch always. If you use carpet it should be warm when you wanna just sit on the floor. Okay enough ranting. I'm kinda nitpicking over here. This hotel is not bad by any means. Might be the best in Semarang too, but well I'm not easily giving 5 stars anywhere. So this place should merit 4.5 stars for me. A great experience all in all... You should at least try once when you go to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Andrieas Nanda,5.0,"The BEST hotel in Semarang. The Location near simpang 5 (best for street food) easy access to nearby famous local food. Complete facility for children and parent, large glass view swimming pool, playground, gym, jacuzzi, sauna. Forgot something? Don't worry Access to tentrem mall is as easy as walking around your home. FnB the best breakfast and dinner you can get in semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Maya,5.0,"Impressed with Tentrem Hotel Yogyakarta, so we chose this hotel to stay while in Semarang. We stayed in not long after it’s opening in 2020. I loved the feeling when entering the Lobby, smell of Lemongrass was very comforting. In the corner you can found a cute Sido Muncul Cart displaying herbs drinks of Indonesia. The room is quite big. We slept in The double twin bed room. The bed is large enough to sleep one adult and one children. So if you’re a family with 2 small children, this room is perfectly fit! In the morning, breakfast was really really impressive yet surprising too. Literally, you don’t have to hustle round the city to have culinary experience. All the famous dishes in Semarang can be found here! From Nasi Ayam Bu Pini, Lumpia Semarang, Asem Asem Koh Lim, Soto Semarang, Wedang Kacang, es Marem etc. Can’t wait to have staycation again in this hotel someday"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Fifi Noveria,5.0,Great place to stay with your family. Located at the heart of Semarang city. Friendly staff. Large size swimming pool.Rooms: 4/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5Hotel highlights Luxury …More
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Handoko Limaho,5.0,"Truly the best Hotel in Semarang…when we were staying here with our family, the hotel was fully booked and we end up in the smoking room. However the management tries to remedy the situation by installing our room with ionizer and room purifier to disperse the scents. The facilities are amazing and especially the breakfast are to die for. We can get all the authentic Semarang food over here. Truly a must place to stay in Semarang"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,George Hadipoespito,4.0,"Great luxury hotel located in the heart of Semarang. Breakfast is the highlight: the restaurant serves samples of famous local heritage restaurants, it’s almost a complete Semarang culinary trip in one sitting. Unfortunately during this stay, service was a little slow: we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a staff to unlock the connecting doors between our two rooms."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,chandra amelia,5.0,"Tentrem Hotel never disappoint. Endless choices of breakfast buffet (ok, not endless, but they do have a vast array of breakfast delicacies), professional and friendly staffs (not to mention fast response too), and their pool is a must-see! Their gym opens until 11pm. Oh this one is also family friendly, the kids club is quite big and definitely entertaining."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Kiki Pratiwi,5.0,"I love my stay here. The staff are so friendly and very helpful. The ambience so lovely , combine between Javanese and Tionghoa. Love their breakfast variation menu. Will definitely stay there again when visit to Semarang."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Freddy Samad,5.0,"Superb hotel as it should carrying the name Tentrem. Room is fabulous and spacious, made with top notch material like mable bathroom and high thread count sheets. The window between the bathroom and the room is electronically dimmable by a flick of switch, I know smart glass existed for quite a while but it's still fancy nonetheless. Soundproof of the room is great, toilet is spotless, shower drainage works fast; everything as it should be. Breakfast is buffet type and has everything from continental to local Semarang delicacies and everything in between, even ice cream if you fancy your early dessert. Their barrister is also very good with their coffee creations, I love both their hot and cold coffees. They also has a great juice bar, sometimes making a acidic delight detox concoction. I highly recommend the breakfast as your stay package. Hotel facilities are also great, swimming pool looks good and there's a direct access to the small mall. Is it expensive? Yes. Would I return? Absolutely."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Firman Adi Prayogo,5.0,"Just one word, Amazing! My first stay at Tentrem Hotel was going very well as I have event there. The receptionist, Saskia (if I am not mistaken) gave me early check in and best room view ever (1709) if you prefer high floor. Furthermore, the breakfast is absolutely one thing that you have to enjoy! As they offer plenty variety of food and also famous Semarang street food. It is magic! Last, I appreciate Saskia when I did check out. She greets me with my name even before I gave my key card. I am truly honoured to stay at Tentrem Hotel Semarang. That is one thing that I never get at any hotel before. Fully recommend to stay here!"

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Riza Satria,2.0,"Service not as good as Tentrem Jogja.. especially breakfast service, staffs were not paying attention to who's first in queue, chaos inside the breakfast area, very low helping attitude among staffs to guests (helping open door, seating arrangements, cutting fruits, etc).. Should bring Tentrem Jogja staffs to help setting Tentrem's standard working culture to Tentrem Semarang.."

Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Tiffany,5.0,"The first thing you'll notice when you enter the hotel is the unique smell, you can smell ginger in the air in almost every area of the hotel. The room is pretty big and clean. They provide many choices and variations on breakfast. The staff are friendly and helpful. They sure are quite expensive, but it's equal to the quality and service they provide"
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Martinus,3.0,"Stayed at the hotel during max occupancy i think. Lines were long, waiting time were also long, request got overlooked. basically they should be working much more efficiently at high load, because Tentrem bears the title best hotel in SMG. However room service is great, food quality was great. Breakfast selection also great. Pool bar service, Health center, Kids area also maintained great service."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Tofik Indradjaja,5.0,"Very nice hotel. Great room, very friendly staff. The only negative thing is when I'm at the pool, I can't charge my food to the room. People usually don't bring wallet or anything to the pool.Rooms: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Location: 5/5 …More"

Service is really good, room is modern n nice. And the best thing is the BREAKFAST!! You can have all Semarang/Central Java culinary in one place and all are good! Breakfast is much much recommended when you stay here."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Veronica Gunawan,5.0,"I could easily give 10 stars for this hotel! Wonderful 5 Star hotel with all of Semarang's iconic cuisines under one roof! I asked one of the chefs there. Apparently the hotel aims to provide local cuisines by buying them directly from the local vendors, so guests don't have to venture out in the heat to taste the local cuisines. Brilliant! It's also strategically located right at the city centre so it's very convenient and easy to get to other places like gift shops, restaurants, Lawang Sewu and Kota Lama. The staff were all so curteous, helpful and friendly, they make you feel at home right away. Even though we stayed during the high season when the hotel is fully booked, it's still easy to get help from the staff. Normally it would be very hard to get anything if the hotel is fully booked, but not here. I also fell in love with the peranakan-themed decor throughout the hotel, and the beautiful paintings they have there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and can't wait to go back and stay there again."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Amrina Rosyada,5.0,"Stayed for 2 nights and 2 days with my husband, we had a large room, clean and sufficient equipment. We had a great 'sahur' with variety menu from local and western food. The taste was good and fresh. This hotel is located next to the tentrem mall where you can find your needs or just killing your time. However, there was a kind of renovation infront of the hotel that made us uncomfortable for waiting outside the hotel main entrance. Though, this hotel deserves the 5 stars for the hospitality of the staffs, the well-managed & clean room, and delicious food."
Hotel Tentrem Semarang,Faela Sufa,5.0,"Arguably the best 5-star hotel in Semarang now. I love Tentrem’s chain. Breakfast selection is great, I love the fact that they serve getuk & plenty traditional food 😍"

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Muhammad Abdul Aziz,5.0,"The Ramadan early breakfast was excellent allowing us to take advantage of the good food.

In front of simpang 5 (park), has a connecting door though the mall. Nice, friendly and very helpful staffs. I booked on website and they gave me a cute little bernard doll and a welcome chocolate cake. What a surprise. My room was located on 7th floor. I only pay not more than 700 idr. Clean room, various choice of breakfast. Definitely will be back"

Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,elmo rinaldi,3.0,"Old hotel and overprice. We stayed for 2 nights and paid Rp 900 k/night. It’s just worth for the very strategic location and access to the mall, but not for the room that is small and few food varieties when breakfast. The lift service and access is also slow. The parking space is small and many car wait at the lobby that cause to traffic."
Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Tom Hietaharju,1.0,Very old hotel with a lot of erosion. Smoking is allowed inside so everywhere smells like old cigarrettes. In rooms full carpet floor was extremely dusty and smelly. Same with curtains. Toilet seat was leaking. Very noisy also. Easily can hear other rooms. Very average breakfast. Some food served cold even join early time breakfast. Only good thing is fast acces to the mall from the lobby. Very expensive for all it's offerings and overall quality. Cannot really recommend in any aspect. Our first and last stay in that hotel.
Hotel Ciputra Semarang managed by Swiss-Belhotel International,Linda Bliss,5.0,The location is strategic in front of city square... it has many features I can't describe all. . this is one of the best hotels in Java for sure.

Breakfast is amazing. 5 different types of Breakfast types from Western to Asian , Chinese....Service is great.

The rooms all have bath and shower."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,rahil kusumawati,5.0,"Really enjoyed and had a relaxing time in this five star hotel for our family holiday. Good service, cleanliness also good.

We will be back there again if we go back to have family holiday in Semarang for sure"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,joko muslim,2.0,"This hotel has advantage in location, however the services need to be improved. As hotel with 5 stars, the reception staffs are lack of initiative to serve and hospitality also need to be improved. The air conditioning in the room can’t be controlled which I felt too chilling. Breakfast is the only best part of this hotel with fast responses staffs. Foods are good and various from western to local. The room are clean with electric water boiler. Complementary mineral drinks were plenty with several tea bags, instant coffee, creamer and sugar. Facilities operate at during daytime and close early, not really suitable for those whose finish work at night. When I arrived at the hotel with motor cycle Gojek, we are not allowed to stop at the main entrance, this felt discriminated.😓😓😓 I did stay there eventually."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Marolop Pardede,3.0,"first time staying at this hotel, the lobby looks clean, smells good, the lighting is good. going up to the room floor, getting out of the elevator was greeted by a musty smell, the smell of damp. my room the impression is also not pleasant. smelly pillow, shower can't be rotated. for a 5-star hotel, the breakfast menu is below my expectations. maybe this will be the first and last experience staying here."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Jessica Natania,5.0,"Great place to stay. The room is spacious and the bathroom as well. Breakfast is good, a lot of variants included the famous lumpia semarang, nasi goreng babat, babat gongso, and soto semarang. Tried those foods earlier from the famous stall, but Gumaya’s is way better. One thing that’s slightly missing for me is their service. In breakfast time, they didn’t help to find table (the situation is crowded and I almost didn’t get a table) or even offer tea/coffee as it’s the most default service they should have. But overall, it was a pleasant stay which I would definitely pay another visit."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,syifa komalasari,5.0,"We stay 5 days at Gumaya Hotel. Everything was nice, the room and bathroom was clean and spacious.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Wee Lee GOH,4.0,Services were super good from front desk and the gate counter. I think previously other people complain and they made big improvement. Enable to speak good English is a plus! I am impressed that they call me up for any comments and help I need. Gate counter help to ensure my grab was well received. Superb! The breakfast is famous which later I heard from my supplier. It offer full range of traditional Central Java food. Indeed is traditional with intestine food provide.However I can not appreciate the traditional Kueh which is too hard for me. I book delux king room. The room is huge but look really old to me. I thought they just renovated. They provide total 6 bottles mineral water which I greatly appreciated What could be better if the swimming pool can close at later time like 9pm would be great.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Herbert Shi,5.0,"Stayed here for 2 nights during Lebaran 2022 oneway chaos. Location is very good, as you can see on the map. Hotel's food is great. It would be perfect if they served ice cream. Service was awesome. Of course there was a certain lady that took care of room checking during breakfast that sometimes got on your nerves... I drove my own car, and parking was nice. The basement was kinda tight for big SUVs. The rooms were very good. Smells so nice. AC was cold and comfy. The beds need replacement soon because it bent so much when you woke up in the morning. Bathroom was perfect👍👍👍. Would definitely come back here 😍"
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Arvin Tanu,5.0,This is NOBLE COURT review. A restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. I really loves this small chinese resto. Taste very good and their menu are different from regular chinese resto. I tried their fried thousand year egg. It was great. Then their xiaolungbao. Their skin was too soft. But tasted very good as well. Their price is not that expensive as well. Very affordable. Overall such an underrated place.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,farida rokhmawati,3.0,"Great location Hotel, Good Food but Disappointed by the hospitality of the receptionist This hotel is located near a lot of shopping center. The room was clean, spacious and the food from the restaurant quite good. After our check out, I asked politely a favor to one the receptionist to take a picture of us on the lobby as a souvenir and she looked weirdly at me then said “a moment”. Her expression made me upset then I asked to a waiter that was in front of the restaurant to help me and that waiter with a big smile took a picture of us. So I would like to say thank you so much for that waiter and please give some hospitality training to that receptionist. If she was not available or maybe don’t want to help, she can try at least to control her expression in front of the guest."
Gumaya Tower Hotel,Miranti Rachmatsaleh,2.0,"Room is spacious but very disappointed with the hotel management. No crowd control during breakfast ended up with long queue, and no options to bring the food to the room. Breakfast area is very crowded which left lots of concern about safety during covid time. They hotel is putting up safety measure like spraying your shoes before entering hotel premises (which is good) but not putting up safety measures at the breakfast hour which left a bigger concern."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Nunki AR,5.0,"We stayed at Gumaya Tower hotel for 4 nights and this hotel is by far the best. Room facilities and cleanliness are good, room air conditioning is easy to adjust according to what we want, spacious bathroom with a bathtub if we use it for a hot bath, it is effective in eliminating aches and pains, making us sleep better. And for water lovers, this hotel provides 6 bottles of 600mL mineral water every day as a complement. Our second day at Gumaya Tower, I got a call from Yessy, the hotel staff, who asked if there were any problems we experienced during our stay. For us, this attention is extraordinary. Thank you Gumaya💜"

Gumaya Tower Hotel,hari r,5.0,"Nice chic place. Excellent facilities. Breakfast is also above par. Lots of various choice, from local to western and continental dishes.

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Derk Wolters,1.0,"We booked a suite for one weekend. Found the suite clean but outdated. Uncomfortable furniture, very limited coffee and tea facility and no minibar. Food that was served in restaurant downstairs was covered with plastic. And whilst we were eating they were already setting tables for the breakfast. Very noisy. Food in skylounge was also not good steak I ordered was cold and the food we ordered cam out not all together but in two servings. For the amount of money I pay for one night , over 4 million idr, it is certainly not worth it. Found the staff not interested with the guests. Not once we were asked if everything was OK. Even at the checking out the receptionist didn't even ask how our stay was and if we enjoyed staying in their hotel. Will not be going back for sure, there are much better hotels to stay in semarang and for a much better and fairer price."

Gumaya Tower Hotel,Lana Nurdewi,5.0,The room (deluxe twin) is quite spacious even with an extra bed. The room facilities all work well and well maintained. The most important is the location. It's in the heart of Semarang.
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Joris Sodenkamp,2.0,"This hotel was our worst experience in Indonesia. When we arrived everything looked perfect, spacious room and a beautiful pool on the roof terrace. After spending a day in the city we found out that our room was full of cockroaches. Families were crawling up the walls and into our bags. They offered us to move to another room but we couldn't trust that another part of the hotel wasn't the same. We had to unpack everything to make sure that didn't any roaches with us. We decided to move to another clean hotel and requested a full refund. They initially told us that this was not possible but we were persistent and got our money back. We were really disappointed because the price of a room gives the impression that this hotel is more luxurious. Unfortunately this is not the case. However, the front desk agent was really helpful with the refund and the hotel is well located in the city."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rendi Suwardi,2.0,"The room is nice, spacious and clean. However I was disappointed with the elevator, they provide only two elevators and they are small, kinda slow.. If you have that many rooms maybe it is nice to have more elevators, in addition, one time, I have to share the elevator with dirty laundry, isn’t there supposed to be seperate service lift? can’t imagine what will it be like in a peak season when they have full occupancy."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Shelvy Arifin,4.0,"The room is relatively big but their window is small that make the room look smaller. The location is the best, a waling distance to the best culinary experience in Simpsng Lima. And you can have your morning jog right in the centre of the city. The one thing that I don't like is the small parking space. Before I stayed there i have read from other guests about the small parking space. But never thought it was that narrow."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rianda Rizza,4.0,"Perfect stay with a little annoying hiccups. The room was excellent, the staffs are super friendly and helpful. No complain at all. The only issue is their parking space which is worst than a corn field maze. If got a space to part on the higher level, then prepare about 30 to 45 minutes just to get out. It is so cramp, that maneuvering is almost impossible in one shot. If you manage to get out of the parking lot without a scratch, I am sure you can pass TÜV driving license test easily. The crazy traffic outside of the hotel was nothing compared to their parking lot."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rizal Iswara,2.0,"Located in thr heart of Semarang, it has a strategic location. Unfortunately they really need to improve their hotel’s hygiene. The room and bath room was not so neat as I expected on a 4 star hotel. And not to mention the breakfast menu, It was the worst breakfast experience I ever had - small area, hot as well as the taste of the food. Disapointment."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,James M.,2.0,"the bathroom is small, there's no door for the shower. The hotel has very awful hygeine, some 3 stars hotel are better than this, the room is quite big but empty. There's uneven coloring on the wall. The staff is kind and was helpful. There was also bed stains on the bedsheet and pillows. The shower head has molds in it. It also has a quite bad smell in the bathroom. Overall this hotel just needs to improve their hygiene. It was dissappointing. Trash can was full of trash from previous guests. The chair is very rough and pointy. The tv screen was laggy, the fps dropped. Too much dust, I sneezed a lot. AC works fine, spacious enough yet crammed. Would not come here again until the hotel learns how to clean properly."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Andi R,3.0,"Im enjoying my stay for 2 days in semarang with this hotel, located at simpang lime. A very active place during weekend especially with their car free days. As much as i enjoy staying here, i had terrible experience with some of the facilities such as hotel rooms that unable to open due to door malfunction, a dirty swimming pool and squeaking lift. Gratefully theyre able to upgrade my room to bigger space for the room technical issue, the pool is public area with no regulation for people to wash before swim hence so many hair and dirts in the pool. on the other hand, the lift need serious maintenance it squeaking as hell. Their service is exceptional yet id like them to do maintenance and evaluate their facilities"
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Sardjito Imam,3.0,"End of July, we stayed on Floor 20, 1BR Studio Connecting - Apartment Louis Kiene Simpang Lima. Room cleanliness and facilities 8 out of 10 - Sheets, pillowcases, mattresses are fragrant and not many spots. TV don't expect much, just local entertainment. - Wall Paper in some places peeling and blotchy. Cleaning and kitchen utensils 6 out of 10 - In the kitchen drawer there is a container for used zinc rust, spots and smells as well as a lot of small animals, sticky pan and spatula are not suitable for use) Cleanliness and bathroom facilities 7 out of 10 - Bathroom Facilities 6 out of 10 (Hot water only lasts 1 minute of use) Many bathroom flies enter the room and kitchen, it is recommended to bring fly and mosquito spray Parking 5 of 10 - Included in the category of the most dangerous apartment for SUV car operators and above, because access to the ramp down and up the car park must be accompanied by a parking attendant, the distance between the wall and the car body is only in the range of 5 - 6 CM left and right with minimal maneuvering, It is not recommended for Beginner drivers and SUV units with a wider and longer body than the 2020 Toyoya KIjang Innova Reborn. - Parking lot is good, enough space between cars to park. The best facilities are in the swimming pool ares, the best view to see the city of Semarang is more than 180 degrees, comfortable, clean and homey seats."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Mariana Diah Rahmawati,1.0,"I am extremely dissapointed with the service of this hotel. I have booked and fully paid last night, but because of the traffic jam from Jakarta to Semarang, we were exhausted. So we had to sleep at a rest area, and we had to take breakfast first. We already called the hotel at around 10.00 am, saying that we needed the room to take refreshment only. The front office said that it's ok, checkout can be arranged at 1.00 pm. But when I finally arrived at the hotel at around 12.40 pm, a front office receptionist named Winda said that my room was already checked out automatically at 12.00 pm. I said I already called and was told that it's ok. How can they give my room (210) to another person? No good answer from the front office. I was really dissapointed. We were really tired and exhausted, and were denied a little hospitality. In the end, we had to book another hotel near by."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Adi Dbgad,4.0,"Close to Simpang Lima Which is the Centre of Semarang. The parking is very tight, must be very careful to park the car. TV program needs more adjustment, since many channels are broken. Rooms: Small but quite roomy."

The bathroom is very clean, even they're not that big (which is fine for me). The hotel is very close with Simpang Lima too. I heard the parking area isn't that good, so you can ask for the valet service, it's free when you're staying there. Overall, stayed in this hotel was a great experience for me!"

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Vincent Yongky,3.0,"Location was super strategic at the middle of famous Simpang Lima. Service was also good, quick check in and quick out. Staff was kind, Security was quick respons. What makes me give 3-stars was the flow of their parking lot, it gives me headache everytime i park my car there, super small, super difficult to getting through, and lotsa scratch on the wall comes from previous car that didn't get through this super difficult parking way, fortunately they give standby-man to guide us whether to park the car or getting out from the building, but still, its so hard to park the car here."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Ilham Sandri Koto,4.0,"The standard 4-star hotel, as same as LK Pandanaran but a little bit different here. The hotel lift is located on B1, not near receptionist (just the apartment lift near receptionist). For the food is just standard here like LK Pandanaran but the breakfast space here is slightly narrower than LK Pandanaran The parking space is also slightly narrower than LK Pandanaran but it has 5 parking floors too. But if you’re looking for the hotels close to the ‘Simpang Lima Semarang’ may be it can be the one of the hotels to stay and according to your specified budget."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Frisco Pratama,2.0,"if you bring medium to big car to Semarang, better you reconsider to choose this hotel since the parking lot really really tricky for manuver your car. and it's quite surprise that the operator for this tricky parking only one pic and many of security officer but not doing anything to help him. thankfully the parking officer quite nice and helpful. but for the location since really close with simpang lima, yes it was quite nice to have a morning walking around simpang lima."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Cliff Gerardo,2.0,"I did not expect the second iteration I visited of the LK Hotels in Semarang had: SLOW & unbearable checkin, NO temperature controlled lobby, little help with luggage from staff, limited seating areas that are socially distanced. The rooms are so small for what they’re charging. Keep in mind we’re staying at the hotel— not the apartments. But still, the staff seemed hesitant to operate quickly and smoothly. VERY unprofessional! Have a big car? PARKING IS AN ISSUE— inhumane unfriendly car park is bound to at least get 2 scratches or dings on your precious automobile. THINK WISELY before booking this place or just don’t bring a car"

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Auting The Explorer,3.0,"The hotel's location is quite strategic in front of the ""Simpang lima"" intersection, but not in accordance with 4-star facilities. The parking space is narrow, you have to be a good driver to park here. It is not recommended for those who bring their own vehicle. The hotel lobby is hot, the restaurant is not up to 4 star standards. There is nothing to expect on the 2 star breakfast menu even though they want to deliver breakfast to the room. The condition of the room is quite clean, the AC is cold and the bed is comfortable."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,ade tri saputra,4.0,"The hotel was good, clean, and I love the pool very much, but the bathroom is very small.

Close to airport, old cities, sam poo khong, business center, government center and culinary center. It has a rooftop swimming pool, the view from that pool is the best. The room is small, and their ceiling is very low. Almost hit my head. Hot water is good and room cleaness is standard. Parking lot is very limited, not recommended if you bring your own car. Breakfast is poor. Limited menu, and the menu is always the same everyday and many of the food is cold. Stay for 3 nights."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Vida Parady,4.0,"Great location, but the apartment staff needs to be more helpful and friendly. The apartment reception looks messy and dirty.

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Olivia OliveTree,4.0,"Stayed thers for a day. Place is strategic, but the entrance is not friendly. Hotel guest must go down by stair to access the elevator in the rear, which is ineffective since we are bringing our luggage. Parking space at the building is not comfortable, too narrow, I saw many vehicles got scratch there. Hotel room is pretty good. Pretty clean. Breakfast is not available during PPKM. Pool has outstanding view. But they are lack of lights, they say it open until 9 pm, but around 6 pm, pool area is very very extremely dark. No staff or pool guard at all. I have to travel down to ground wearing towel to ask for light."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Daniel,3.0,"I wouldn't necessarily call this a luxury hotel. Yes, it's well located, just right by Simpang Lima, the heart of the city. Rooms are spacious and quite comfy. However, walls are thin, and it's not well maintained and there are spots that need to be better cleaned around the premise. If breakfast is not included in your fare, don't bother. The breakfast is very limited (space and the menu), it's a lot better to have breakfast in other restaurant nearby."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Jessica Tampi,3.0,Room is very nice. Clean. Neat and tidy. Big king size bed as requested. But unfortunately the parking lot is too narrow and now representing 4star hotel at all. Also lobby too hot & access to hotel only using 2 lifts that connect to parking lot.

Bed sheet and towel looks old."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Anisa Bahar,3.0,"The room and bed are spacious. Great. Small parking lot. But we used the Valet Service. the bumper of my car is dented. the scratch is very large. but they didn’t want to admit their mistake, even when we ask for their CCTV footage. Not recommended for guests carrying lots items or large suitcases, access to the hotel lift is a bit far and must pass through the stairs while no officers are ready to help And The Bellboy services were taking too long. The Front Desk Officer was busy taking phone and other stuff while I was talking to her 👎🏻 Overall for me staying at this hotel quite pleasant but if there is a chance to stay there again, ABSOLUTE BIG NO NO."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,sebastio achmad,2.0,It's just not like the name where tempting to stay. Wondering it was so luxurious and outstanding. But it's truly beyond from the expectations. Building is like an old need so many maintenance. AC didn't work well at the lobby also inside room. Restaurant is so tiny with less variant and bad taste. Parking is trouble with small space row. Hospitality is ok from the staff.
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Drady Mica Oryza Bagaswara,4.0,"+ Nice room & spacey (Children can play well). + Modern concept. + Strategic place in midtown near Simpang Lima & Shopping Center. + Don't have to worry about what would we ate on lunch nor dinner, there are a lot of street food around the hotel & Simpang Lima. + On roof top, there's a quite big swimming pool within edge of the building wall so we could see the midtown's wide view. + In room deposit box, water boiler & mini fridge available. - Very limited (narrow) space to turning in parking lot. - Elevators are often ""warm"" (even I can described it as ""hot"") due no AC inside. - To access the hotel room, we need to use stairs to B1 which is no slope/slide floor to bring case etc. (the elevator right in front of receptionist only accessed to W/R apartment which is it still same building with the hotel, only different section). - A lot of dirt under the bed, housekeeper need to more often to clean it up."

Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,jusman hutama,4.0,"Strategic location, within walking distance to Alun-alun Simpang Lima. Unfortunately, parking ramp very small. Large sedan (Accord, Camry, E-Class) and big MPV (Alphard) definitely cannot park in the garage. Service is ok. No complain yet."
Louis Kienne Hotel Simpang Lima,Rima Wahyuningsih,2.0,"Disappointed with the service. Also the lift is very inconvenient for parking and apartment. The parking area is too small. I feel like the architect is failed to build a proper parking space. It's better for you to book grab if you stay here if you rent a car confirm your car will got scratch. Only the building looks grand luxury. But really sucks for me. Also the apartment sink has very strong odors that makes me need to cover the hole when i don't use. The breakfast also not worth IDR 100K for those food, and majority of the food taste too salty."

There are only two small elevator located at basement. So we have to wait for long time. Basement is quite hot/not well ventilated. -walls are not well covered. We can hear people chattering and knocking at other rooms clearly. -my friend lost her bag (goodie bag) with lots of souvenirs inside. -no guards at swimming pool. Consider this is a 4 star hotel, i think its not worth it to pay 1mio++ with those poor facilities and service."
Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Hendra Kusuma,4.0,"Shower area can be further cleaned by cleaning up the black grout spot (brushed with bleach / spray will loosened up the fungus growth) It need more power sources / wall plug in the room to allow laptop computer, Smartphones, etc. charging. Provide Hair Dryer as standard room convenience. Provide, 3 types of towels for 2 per room. Provide Hair shampoo & conditioner as standard (only shampoo was provided during my stay).. Repair / Secure ward robe door, so it does not drop / fall as I almost drop it when it slip off the track and almost drop on my foot (may crushed my feet from the weight of the mirror door).

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,ana purna,2.0,"the hotel is old and needs makeover. the shower was never consistent, alternating between hot and cold water no matter the setting. some of the staff need better training. they lacked coordination with car rental. the breakfast selection had local choice, but the taste was under average."
Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Meida Ardina,5.0,"The only thing I don't like is the air-conditioner was just too cold for certain rooms. Also they need to add variation of food, I think. The sales might need to check and re-check the details of the reservation. Especially the date. But well mistake happened, it's been taken care of. I'm glad the sales did everything she could to heed my request, from my organisation, which was excellent from their part. I really appreciated the sales's effort! The meeting room was also good, but I suggest they add a whiteboard. Because flipchart isn't wide enough and some people found it a bit hard to see, especially those who were at the back. Everything else were amazing. Please keep up the good work!"

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Moto 4nn4,5.0,Good clean old fashion room. Spacious room. Working hoh/cols shower in bathroom. Aircon may cause aome irritate noise when set to highest speed guess due its usage but it still give the coolest air we want on hot summer day. Nowaday new hotel provide chiller but Santika still has the real refrigerator good to cool our bottle of drink. Poolnis spacious and the officer do the job to welcome the guest prepare the rest chair and provide the bath.. well compare nowaday hotel that guest NEED to ask or visit the towel counter.. Santika bring the even simpe customer experience ahead. Check in/out is fast the concierge bring our belonging to. room. Parking is spacious and due the hotel location in city area is very good. Breakfast is modesty but they still serve/pick it for guest while other hotel may loosen the requirement but we can understand if this is hotel's way signature to maintain hygiene in 'pandemic loosen time' but pls review it as common guest hotel may prefer to choose its own food. Free rentnfor bicyle very good.. Used it to nearestn convenience store.

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,B. Jonathan T.,3.0,"Used to be a quite fancy hotel. The lobby still looks premium but the ceiling has been water damaged and looks deteriorating. Once you enter the room it feels as budgety as a budget hotel. Cool white lights make it feel a little cheap, no real mugs in the room only paper cups and cheap plastic cups in the bathroom. The floor used to be made of carpet and contrasted with ceramic, now replaced with regular ceramic tiles for the whole room, they removed the bath tub and replaced it with a shower only. They removed the wallpapers and painted the walls brownish white. Much more to rant about for my disappointment. Overall it is a good hotel but as a person who used to go here all the time this makes me very sad and disappointed, They gutted almost everything that makes me enjoy staying here. Definitely no longer a 4 star hotel in terms of room feel except for the spacious rooms. The service and food still remains excellent as always."

Hotel Santika Premiere Semarang,Teguh Sunyoto,1.0,"At check in, we asked receptionist to store breast milk in their freezer (we also already wrote word ""freezer"" in the plastic milk container) as we plan for 2 nights stay. For the information, it was a 700ml breast milk that was pumped by my wife during our 4 days trip prior to arriving to this hotel. In fact, we have also asked this (whether the hotel can store breast milk in their freezer) via phone before we book the room, and they confirm providing the service for their guest. It turned out, at check out, the hotel staff did not store our breast milk in the freezer instead they store it in a chiller and as a result our breast milk spoiled and can no longer be used/given to our baby. All the hotel staffs did just say sorry without any explanation, they don't understand how much effort my wife have done to pump that breast milk during our trip. The above was not the only disappointing experiences we had in this hotel.. on the morning when we ready to go for breakfast the electricity suddenly turn off for almost 1 hour.. as a result we must go down to the restaurant from 6th floor using emergency stair. Btw, I have my parent (78 and 65 years old) with me and also a 3 month baby with its stroller. This was a terrible experiences for our family. We also have to eat our breakfast without light.
